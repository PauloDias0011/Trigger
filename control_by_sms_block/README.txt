<=> This is an Automated SMS System, developed to complete the Course Conclusion Work. <=>

 This block was developed for work with a daemon. Then you should install the block in Moodle
and starts the daemon in your server. I believe that if you are running Moodle and the daemon
in the same machine, no 'in code' configurations will be necessary in the daemon, you will
need to have a database and allow it to be accessed by the daemon.

 By the way, read the manual to learn how to set up all the plugin. I recommend you to read
the monografy that describes all the development of the plugin. If you really want to imple-
ment this plugin for your institution, you will need to upgrade the plugin. To do this, you
should know how it's works, the weak points and the recommended upgrade points.

+--------------------

 The main features for the plug-in is:

    1. Offers you the quality of disponibility. That is, you can access the plugin services
    whatever you are; by texting SMS;

    2. You can communitcate with multiple choosen destinations;

    3. You can set up when the messages will be sent;

    4. With the qualit of disponibility, you can implement whatever services that you want
    and can have them accessed in Moodle, out of Moodle web interface.

+--------------------

 The master feature for this plug-in is:

    => You can dettach the daemon entity and use him with anyone applications of your choice.
    To get this working, the application must speak RPC, and you will need to re-write the
    scripts in the daemon that validate the user and retrieve the destinations from the data-
    base. All of this stuff are docummented in the monografy of this work. Even a manual that
    explain ever step to get this plug-in working (but the manual was written in portuguese).

+--------------------

 *Keep in mind for this software: plugin = block + daemon; working togheter.

 *To get the monografy, contact me by email.

 *Hope this block will be helpful =)
