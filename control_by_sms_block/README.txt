<=> This is an Automated SMS System, developed to complete the Course Conclusion Work. <=>

 This block was developed for work with a daemon. Then you should install the block in Moodle 
and starts the daemon in your server. I believe that if you are running Moodle and the daemon 
in the same machine, no 'in code' configurations will be necessary in the daemon, you will 
need to have a database and allow it to be accessed by the daemon.

 By the way, read the manual to learn how to set up all the plugin. I recommend you to read 
the monografy that describes all the development of the plugin. If you really want to imple-
ment this plugin for your institution, you will need to upgrade the plugin. To do this, you 
should know how it's works, the weak points and the recommended upgrade points.

+--------------------

 The main features for the plugin is:

    1. Offers you the quality of disponibility. That is, you can access the plugin services 
    whatever you are; by texting SMS;

    2. You can communitcate with multiple choosen destinations;

    3. You can set up when the messages will be sent;

    4. With the qualirt of disponibility, you can implement whatever services that you want 
    and can have them accessed in Moodle, out of Moodle web interface.


 *Keep in minf for this software: plugin = block + daemon; working togheter.
